# .env collector

Do you know the struggle of losing all your .env files when moving laptops? Not anymore! Make sure the right folders are selected in the `start` command in `package.json`, run `npm start` and you'll get a folder structure of all .env (and .env.local, .local.env, .env.development etc) files you can easily copy to a new project home. 

Currently only tested on Windows. Feel free to test/fix it for OSX :)
